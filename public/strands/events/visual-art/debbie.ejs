                A solo exhibition by Debbie Godsell. The infinite whatever is a term coined by the New York Times travel writer Eric
                Werner who describes his experiences of â€˜thin&#39;places as where &#39;&#39;the distance between heaven and earth collapses and we
                glimpse the divine, transcendent, or the infinite whatever&#39;&#39;. Debbie Godsell responds to Werner&#39;s theory with imagery of
                the west Cork landscape- documenting such places where a person may experience a sense of wellbeing. Alongside the
                landscape, the image of the child explores fragility and the belief that children live close to these &#39;thin&#39; places.
