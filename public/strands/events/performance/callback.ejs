                From the company who brought you the HIT show Fred & Alice . . . What would happen if you woke up
                one morning, found yourself in the middle of a snow storm and you have no power, no heat, no phone, no food?

                Welcome to the world of Janey Dillis, Janey hasn't left her house in 25 years. No one has set foot inside her house
                in 20 years which up till now has been just the way she likes it.
