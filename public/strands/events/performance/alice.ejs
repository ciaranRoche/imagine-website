                A spooky tale for Halloween. This classic literary tale enthrals and engages children and adults alike, as
                they follow Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands into a world full of fantastic people and strange and
                unpredictable events. Originally adapted for the stage by Jocelyn Clarke, this acclaimed production was
                restaged by Blue Raincoat last year as part of the company&#39;s 25th year celebrations. This fast-paced and
                physical retelling of Alice in Wonderland has a running time of 70 minutes, no interval.
